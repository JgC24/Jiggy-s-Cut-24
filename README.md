# Jiggy's Cut 24 - Whatever that is!


### Pre-Installation:

1. Install Visual C++ x64 & .Net Runtime v5 desktop x64.
2. Change Skyrim so it does not automatically update.
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games.
4. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
5. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like C:\Games is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonist's SteamLibrary tool.
6. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
7. Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the paid addon files.
8. Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These will mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.
9. Install the Skyrim Special Edition: Creation Kit on Steam and run it at least once.
